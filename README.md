- 👋 Hi, I’m @Samichpower
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Building simple programs to assist with my hobbies, and eventually making websites to host them. Also plan on learning to develop games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Javascript, alongside HTML and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Perhaps games, though I'm not proficient with any language yet. If you want a simple calculator with no interface, I got you.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Github/Reddit
